Restroom Alert
==============

### Our Problem

- Restroom is a mile long walk.
- Every time you go the restroom the cleaning guy/girl is in the restroom cleaning it up.
- You can't enter the restroom when they cleaning up, they give you a coldest stare ever.

### Solution

- Place a sensor attached to spark core in the door.
- When the door is open for some amount of time it will notify people, holdon for a while).
- When the door is closed the user is notified again, so that they can use the restroom.
